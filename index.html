        <p>
            People travel for many reasons, including to learn about unfamiliar places and cultures, to visit friends and families and for professional purposes. Travellers may, however, encounter various health risks while away from home.  It is important to be prepared for them. Anyone planning travel should seek information or advice on potential health risks before travel with the goal of staying safe and healthy while away. 

This page provides information about infectious disease risks and vaccination requirements and links to additional sources of information about travel and health.
